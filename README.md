## How Watson Studio can help you rapidly prototype AI solutions
IBM Watson Studio has powerful machine learning and deep learning features. But did you know it also has simple tools for quickly training and deploying AI models and for prototyping app code? These examples show you how to leverage open data to train a visual recognition models using the graphical model builder in Watson Studio and then create a web app that uses that model.

### Scavenger hunt BINGO
This example shows you how to train a visual recognition model using the graphical model builder in Watson Studio and then create a fun, scavenger hunt app that uses that model.

### Flags national anthem app
This sample demonstrates how to build a web app that uses a visual recognition model to classify images of flags and then play the national anthem of the country of the flag.
